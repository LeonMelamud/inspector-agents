## Post-Phase-1 Improvements (Feb 8, 2026)

- Fixed rate limiter: replaced leaking `setInterval` with sliding-window + lazy eviction
- Fixed sanitization: HTML-entity encoding instead of stripping, null-byte removal
- Fixed TrackedLink: uses Next.js `<Link>` for SPA navigation
- Fixed next.config: removed `output: 'export'` (was incompatible with API routes)
- Fixed footer typos: "inspectagnets" → "inspectagents"
- Added site-wide Navbar component with mobile hamburger menu
- Fixed SEO utility: `generateArticleSEO` properly merges base metadata
- Moved animations from `<style jsx>` to `globals.css` Tailwind utilities
- Updated AGENTS.md with project-specific instructions
- Cleaned up README.md and PRD.md (removed stale "static export" references)

## Deployment Status (Feb 8, 2026)

- Resend configured in Vercel (RESEND_API_KEY + RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID set)
- Removed n8n and ConvertKit — Resend is the sole email provider
- Deleted: n8n-email-workflow.json, docs/N8N_SETUP.md
- Simplified: route.ts, email.ts, EMAIL_SETUP.md, .env.example, README.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, PRD.md, privacy page
- Site deployed on Vercel Hobby tier
