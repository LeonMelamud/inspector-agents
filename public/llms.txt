## API

- [Agent Feedback Endpoint](https://inspectagents.com/api/agent-feedback): AI agents can POST feedback, corrections, or new incident reports (JSON body: {type, message, source, url})

## MCP Server (Model Context Protocol)

InspectAgents exposes a Streamable HTTP MCP server. AI agents can connect to search failures, assess risk, and retrieve checklists programmatically.

- **Endpoint**: POST https://inspectagents.com/api/mcp/ (IMPORTANT: use trailing slash)
- **Discovery**: https://inspectagents.com/.well-known/mcp.json
- **Required Headers**:
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` (REQUIRED — server returns 406 without this)
- **Mode**: Stateless (no session tracking, no SSE streaming)

### Quick Start — Copy-Paste Example

```
POST https://inspectagents.com/api/mcp/
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json, text/event-stream

{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-03-26","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"your-agent","version":"1.0.0"}}}
```

After initialize, call `tools/list` to discover tools, then `tools/call` to execute them.

- **Available Tools:**
  - `search_failures` — Search/filter the 500+ AI failures database by query, category, severity, year
  - `get_failure` — Get full details of a single failure by ID
  - `assess_risk` — Run the AI risk assessment quiz programmatically
  - `get_checklist` — Retrieve the 56-point testing checklist (filterable by severity/section)
  - `submit_feedback` — Submit feedback, corrections, or new incident reports
- **Available Resources:**
  - `inspectagents://failures/all` — Full failures database as structured JSON
  - `inspectagents://checklist/full` — Complete 56-point checklist

### Common Mistakes
- Using `/api/mcp` without trailing slash → 308 redirect (use `/api/mcp/`)
- Missing `Accept` header → 406 Not Acceptable (must include `application/json, text/event-stream`)
