### Maker Intro (First Comment - Post Immediately After Launch)

```markdown
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], and I've spent the last [X months/years] documenting every major AI agent failure I could find. The result? A database of 500+ incidents where chatbots hallucinated, got jailbroken, or destroyed company reputations.

**The problem**: Teams are shipping AI agents without testing them properly. They think "it works in the demo" means it's production-ready. Then they get hit with:
- Chevrolet's chatbot selling $1 cars (prompt injection)
- Air Canada forced to honor hallucinated refund policy (lost lawsuit)
- DPD chatbot swearing at customers (jailbreak)
- Google Bard costing $100B in market cap (factual error)

**What I built**:

🗄️ **AI Failures Database** - 500+ searchable, filterable real incidents with:
- Full incident timeline
- Business impact ($$$)
- Prevention strategies
- Source citations

🧪 **Interactive Risk Quiz** - 7 questions that reveal your AI vulnerability level:
- Personalized risk score
- Top 3 priority actions
- Social proof ("You're not alone - 72% fear reputation damage")

✅ **50-Point Testing Checklist** - Print-friendly PDF covering:
- Hallucination detection
- Prompt injection prevention
- Jailbreak resistance
- Security & privacy
- Bias auditing
- Production monitoring

**Why it's free**: I believe AI testing shouldn't be gatekept. Every team - from solo founders to enterprises - deserves to ship safe AI. The failures database alone took 200+ hours to compile. It's my contribution to making AI safer.

**What I need from you**:
1. Try the quiz - it takes 2 minutes and reveals blind spots
2. Browse the failures database - filter by severity, category, year
3. Share which AI failure shocked you most
4. Tell me what's missing - what would make this MORE useful?

I'm here all day to answer questions about specific failures, testing strategies, or how to prevent your AI from going viral for the wrong reasons.

Let's make AI agents safer, together. 🚀

P.S. - The database includes some wild ones I haven't publicly written about yet. Looking at you, ChatGPT lawyer who cited fake cases... 👀

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Launching on a weekend** - Weekdays (Tue-Thu) get more traffic
2. **Not responding to comments** - First 2 hours are critical
3. **Being salesy in responses** - Be helpful, not promotional
4. **Ignoring negative feedback** - Address concerns thoughtfully
5. **Not testing links** - Broken links kill conversions
6. **Launching without supporters** - Seed initial upvotes authentically
7. **Writing a boring first comment** - Tell a story, not a feature list
8. **Not engaging with other products** - Community karma matters
9. **Launching too many features at once** - One clear value prop
10. **Not tracking which PH visitors convert** - Add UTM: `?ref=producthunt`
