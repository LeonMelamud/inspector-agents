### Email Subject Line
```
Story idea: 500+ documented AI failures with prevention strategies (free database)
```

### Email Body
```
Hi TLDR AI team,

I built a resource I think your readers would find immediately useful.

**What it is:**
A free, searchable database of 500+ verified AI chatbot failures (2016-2024), including:
- Chevrolet's chatbot selling a $1 car (prompt injection attack)
- Air Canada losing a lawsuit over hallucinated bereavement policy
- Google Bard's $100B stock price demo error
- ChatGPT lawyer cited fake court cases, got sanctioned
- DPD chatbot started swearing at customers after jailbreak

Each incident includes technical root cause, business impact, prevention strategies, and source citations.

**Why TLDR readers care:**

The data reveals critical patterns:
- 72% of failures are hallucinations (grounding problems, not model limitations)
- 18% are prompt injection (wildly underestimated threat)
- 85% had no rollback mechanism in place
- 78% had no output validation
- Most are preventable with basic testing

Every team building AI agents is repeating the same mistakes. This database helps them learn from others' disasters.

**What's included:**
- Searchable database with filter by category/severity/year
- 50-point testing checklist based on failure analysis
- 2-minute risk assessment quiz
- Prevention playbooks for each failure type
- All free, no signup required

**Early traction** (as of [DATE]):
- [#X] Product of the Day on Product Hunt ([X] votes)
- [X] points on Hacker News
- [X] quiz completions in first 72 hours
- [X] unique visitors from [X] countries

**Link**: https://inspectagents.com/failures

The technical depth should resonate with your audience - these aren't surface-level "AI is bad" stories, they're actionable case studies with specific prevention strategies.

Would you be interested in featuring this for TLDR AI readers?

- Exclusive data insights
- Custom graphics/charts
- Expert quotes
- Behind-the-scenes methodology

### Email Subject Line
```
Exclusive for The Rundown: We analyzed 500+ AI failures - here's what the data reveals
```

### Email Body
```
Hi Rowan and The Rundown team,

After watching Chevrolet's chatbot sell a $1 car, Air Canada lose a lawsuit over hallucinations, and DPD's bot start swearing at customers, I spent 6 months documenting every major AI agent failure I could verify.

The result: 500+ incidents, fully searchable, with prevention strategies for each.

**The exclusive data for The Rundown readers:**

📊 **Failure type breakdown:**
- 72% Hallucinations (grounding failures, NOT model limitations)
- 18% Prompt injection (severely underestimated risk)
- 6% Jailbreaks (creative adversarial attacks)
- 4% Security/privacy breaches

💰 **Cost distribution:**
- <$10K: 35% of documented failures
- $10K-$100K: 40%
- $100K-$1M: 18%
- $1M+ (catastrophic): 7%
  - Includes Google Bard's $100B stock drop
  - Air Canada's legal precedent (company liable for AI outputs)
  - Zillow's $881M loss from flawed algorithms

🎯 **The critical prevention gap:**
- 85% had NO rollback mechanism
- 78% had NO output validation
- 92% had NO adversarial testing
- 67% had NO human oversight

**What teams consistently get wrong:**

They assume "works in demo" = production ready. They don't test for:
- Prompt injection attacks (Chevrolet-style pricing manipulations)
- Hallucination detection (Air Canada policy contradictions)
- Jailbreak resistance (DPD profanity bypass)
- Security vulnerabilities (Samsung trade secret leaks to ChatGPT)

**The resource:**
- Searchable database: https://inspectagents.com/failures
- 50-point testing checklist based on failure analysis
- 2-minute risk assessment quiz
- All free, no signup wall

**Early validation** (as of [DATE]):
- [#X] Product of the Day on Product Hunt
- [X] upvotes on Hacker News
- [X] teams completed risk quiz
- [X] checklist downloads
- [Featured in: LIST IF APPLICABLE]

**Why The Rundown readers care:**

Your audience is building with AI, deploying agents, making purchasing decisions. They need to know what went wrong elsewhere so they don't repeat it.

These aren't hypothetical risks - every incident in the database is verified with source citations.

**Exclusive offer for The Rundown:**

I can provide:
- Deeper data analysis (industries most affected, cost trends over time)
- Expert quote on AI deployment safety you can use
- Custom visualizations/graphics for your newsletter format
- Behind-the-scenes methodology breakdown
- First look at new failure categories as they emerge

This would be a valuable resource piece for your readers - tactical, data-driven, immediately actionable.

### Email Subject Line
```
Resource for AI Breakfast: The Carfax for AI agents (500+ documented failures)
```

### Email Body
```
Hi AI Breakfast team,

I'm [Your Name], and I've spent the past 6 months building what I call "the Carfax for AI agents" - a searchable database of 500+ verified chatbot failures with prevention strategies.

**Quick pitch:**

I think AI Breakfast readers would benefit from a free resource that helps them learn from real AI disasters before deploying their own agents.

**What makes it practical:**

1. **Real incidents, verified sources**
   - Chevrolet dealership chatbot: sold $1 car via prompt injection
   - Air Canada: lost lawsuit, court ruled company liable for AI hallucinations
   - Google Bard: $100B stock price drop from factual error in demo
   - ChatGPT lawyer: cited fake cases, got sanctioned
   - Samsung: employees leaked trade secrets to ChatGPT
   - 495+ more, all with source citations

2. **Actionable prevention strategies**
   - Each failure includes specific tests that would've caught it
   - 50-point testing checklist organized by risk category
   - 2-minute risk quiz to identify blind spots
   - Filter by category, severity, year

3. **Data-driven insights your readers can use**
   - 72% are hallucinations (grounding failures, not model limits)
   - 18% are prompt injection (massively underestimated)
   - 85% had no rollback mechanism (deployment gap)
   - 78% had no output validation (testing gap)

**Why AI Breakfast readers care:**

Your audience is likely:
- Building AI agents or chatbots
- Evaluating AI tools for their company
- Advising teams on AI strategy
- Trying to understand AI risks

This database helps them:
- Learn from real disasters (with receipts)
- Identify testing gaps before deployment
- Make informed risk decisions
- Avoid repeating expensive mistakes

**Link**: https://inspectagents.com/failures

**Current traction** (as of [DATE]):
- [#X] on Product Hunt ([X] votes)
- [X] points on Hacker News
- [X] quiz completions
- [X] unique visitors in [X] days
- [Featured mentions: IF ANY]

**What I can offer AI Breakfast:**

- Expert perspective on AI deployment safety
- Custom analysis angle for your readers
- Exclusive data insights (industry trends, cost patterns)
- Q&A format if that's a better fit
- Ongoing updates as new failures emerge

The database is genuinely useful - not just "AI can fail" fearmongering, but "here's what went wrong and how to prevent it" tactical guidance.

Would you be interested in featuring this in an upcoming edition?

Happy to provide any additional information, screenshots, or data that would help.
