## 📧 Email Template 1: TLDR AI

**Subject Line Options**:
- `Story idea: We compiled 500+ AI chatbot failures (Chevrolet $1 car, Air Canada lawsuit, etc.)`
- `Resource for TLDR readers: Searchable database of AI failures with prevention tips`
- `New AI safety resource your readers will love`

**Email Body**:

```
Hi [Editor name - Dan Ni or research who's current],

I'm reaching out with a resource I think TLDR AI readers would find valuable.

**What it is:**
A free, searchable database of 500+ real AI chatbot failures (2016-2024), including:
- Chevrolet's chatbot selling a $1 car (prompt injection)
- Air Canada losing a lawsuit over hallucinated policy
- Google Bard's $100B demo error
- ChatGPT lawyer citing fake court cases

Each incident includes:
- Technical root cause (hallucination, prompt injection, jailbreak, security)
- Business impact assessment
- Prevention strategies
- Source citations

Plus a free 50-point testing checklist and 2-minute risk quiz.

**Why TLDR readers care:**
- 72% of failures are hallucinations (grounding problems, not model limits)
- 18% are prompt injection (wildly underestimated threat)
- 85% had no rollback mechanism
- Most are preventable with basic testing

Every team building AI agents is repeating the same mistakes. This database helps them learn from others' disasters.

**Proof of traction:**
[Include stats after launch week, e.g.:]
- #[X] Product of the Day on Product Hunt
- [X]+ upvotes on Hacker News
- [X] quiz completions in first week
- Featured in [publications/communities]

**Link**: https://inspectagents.com/failures

Happy to provide any additional details, screenshots, or exclusive insights for TLDR readers.

## 📧 Email Template 2: The Rundown AI

**Subject Line Options**:
- `Exclusive for The Rundown: We analyzed 500+ AI failures - here's the data`
- `AI safety resource your readers need: Free failures database + testing checklist`
- `Story pitch: The hidden patterns in AI chatbot disasters`

**Email Body**:

```
Hi Rowan [or current editor],

I built something I think The Rundown audience would find immediately useful.

**The Story:**
After watching Chevrolet's chatbot sell a $1 car, Air Canada lose a lawsuit over hallucinations, and DPD's bot start swearing at customers, I spent 6 months documenting every major AI agent failure I could verify.

The result: 500+ incidents, fully searchable, with prevention strategies.

**The Data (Exclusive for The Rundown):**

📊 Failure breakdown:
- 72% Hallucinations (grounding failures, not model issues)
- 18% Prompt injection (severely underestimated)
- 6% Jailbreaks (creative human attacks)
- 4% Security/privacy breaches

💰 Cost distribution:
- <$10K: 35% of failures
- $10K-100K: 40%
- $100K-$1M: 18%
- $1M+: 7% (includes Google's $100B Bard error)

🎯 Prevention gap:
- 85% had no rollback mechanism
- 78% had no output validation
- 92% had no adversarial testing

**What teams get wrong:**
They assume "works in demo" = production ready. They don't test for:
- Prompt injection (Chevrolet-style attacks)
- Hallucination detection (Air Canada policy contradictions)
- Jailbreak resistance (DPD profanity bypass)
- Security (Samsung trade secret leaks)

**The Resource:**
Free database + 50-point testing checklist + 2-minute risk quiz

https://inspectagents.com/failures

**Why The Rundown readers care:**
Your audience is building with AI. They need to know what went wrong elsewhere so they don't repeat it.

**Offer for The Rundown:**
Happy to provide:
- Exclusive data insights for your readers
- Expert quote on AI deployment safety
- Behind-the-scenes methodology
- Custom graphics/visuals

Would love to collaborate on this. What would make this most valuable for your audience?

**Email Body**:

```
Hi [Editor name],

I'm [Your name], and I've been analyzing AI chatbot failures for the past 6 months.

**Quick pitch:**
I think AI Breakfast readers would benefit from a free resource I built - a searchable database of 500+ real AI agent failures with prevention strategies.

**What makes it useful:**

1. **Real incidents, verified sources**
   - Chevrolet $1 car (prompt injection)
   - Air Canada lawsuit (hallucination)
   - Google Bard $100B error (factual mistake)
   - ChatGPT lawyer sanctions (fake citations)
   - 496+ more, all with source citations

2. **Actionable prevention tips**
   - Each failure includes specific tests that would've prevented it
   - 50-point testing checklist based on failure analysis
   - 2-minute risk quiz to find blind spots

3. **Data-driven insights**
   - 72% are hallucinations (not model limits - grounding failures)
   - 18% are prompt injection (underestimated by most teams)
   - 85% had no rollback mechanism (deployment gap)

**Why this matters to your audience:**
AI Breakfast readers are likely building agents, evaluating AI tools, or advising on AI strategy. This database helps them:
- Learn from real disasters
- Identify testing gaps
- Prevent repeating mistakes
- Make informed deployment decisions

**Link**: https://inspectagents.com/failures
