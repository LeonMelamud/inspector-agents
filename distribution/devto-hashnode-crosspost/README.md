## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Canonical URL Not Showing
**Solution:** Some platforms hide canonical URLs by default. Make sure:
- Frontmatter includes `canonical_url` field
- URL is absolute (starts with https://)
- You've saved the post (some platforms only show on save)

### Issue: Cover Image Not Displaying
**Solution:**
- Use direct image URLs (not embedded images)
- Ensure URL starts with https://
- Try Unsplash URLs provided in frontmatter
- Max recommended size: 1000px wide, <500KB

### Issue: Markdown Not Rendering
**Solution:**
- Check for special characters that need escaping
- Ensure code blocks use triple backticks (```)
- Preview before publishing
- Some platforms have markdown quirks (test in draft mode)

### Issue: Low Engagement
**Solution:**
- Post at optimal times (Tuesday-Thursday 9-11 AM EST)
- Engage in comments within first hour
- Share on Twitter/LinkedIn immediately after publishing
- Ask a question in the article to spark discussion
- Cross-promote in relevant communities
